# State Estimation Evaluation Testbed

**Early-stage evaluation infrastructure for state reconstruction under degraded observations.**

This repository defines the state-estimation evaluation responsibility within
Notation Systems' computational instrumentation stack. Its scope covers
reconstruction under noise, missing observations, latency, and other measurement
degradation, with the plant and measurement model declared explicitly.

## Status and implemented contents

This checkout contains a declarative invariant corpus, its citation, and the
first executable contract slice. It does not yet contain an estimator,
evaluation runner, numerical solver, simulation, fault-injection runner,
benchmark results, or physical-validation certificate.

The existing corpus declares:

- `plant.declared`: estimation requires a declared plant and measurement model.
- `var.x`: the state coordinate requires `declared-H`.
- `claim_scope: computational-integrity-only`.

These declarations do not establish physical validity, estimator accuracy,
observability, or a stability certificate. Noise, missingness, and latency are
evaluation concerns, not implemented perturbation generators in this checkout.

### Instrument exchange contract

`state_estimation_testbed.contracts` validates the v1 instrument exchange
boundary for observation batches, numerical result artifacts, verification
artifacts, and covariance eligibility. It enforces:

- ordered variables, per-component units, coordinate frame, and tangent-space
  evaluation point;
- finite square covariance matrices, symmetry and numerical positive-semidefinite
  checks under the tolerances described below, with an effective-rank estimate;
- explicit unknown covariance rather than a fabricated zero matrix;
- retained source and calibration references; and
- verification summaries consistent with their checks, with internal and
  independent verification kept distinct.

Numerical eligibility does not establish calibration validity, sensor truth,
model adequacy, physical applicability, estimator accuracy, or stability.

The covariance check uses unpivoted LDLᵀ with a default PSD tolerance of
`1e-12 * max(1, max(abs(matrix)))`. Singular-matrix acceptance is scale-sensitive:
`[[1e-14, 1e-7], [1e-7, 1]]` is a rank-one positive-semidefinite outer product,
but the current validator rejects it because its first pivot is treated as zero
while the off-diagonal residual exceeds that tolerance. Rejection therefore does
not establish a negative eigenvalue, and reported rank is a tolerance-dependent
numerical estimate.

Run the executable contract slice with `python -m pytest`.

## Technical responsibility

The testbed's responsibility is to evaluate state reconstruction against a
declared model and explicitly characterized observations. Estimator
implementations retain their own identities and mathematical assumptions; this
repository is not the authoritative implementation of every estimator.

A reported evaluation must distinguish its source observations, model
declarations, estimator operation and version, execution attempt, computed
result, and verification evidence. Declaring an invariant is separate from
executing an evaluation or verifying its result.

## Relationship to the instrumentation stack

These are component responsibilities, not claims of complete working
integrations in this early-stage repository.

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **State Estimation Evaluation Testbed** | Evaluation of reconstruction under declared observation degradation. |
| [Provenance-Preserving Data Acquisition](https://github.com/giasonpooni/Provenance-Preserving-Data-Acquisition) | Source acquisition, observations, extraction lineage, and explicit missingness. |
| [Evidence and State Management](https://github.com/giasonpooni/Evidence-and-State-Management) | Evidence retention, versioned state, admission, and release management. |
| [Scientific Computation Runtime](https://github.com/giasonpooni/Scientific-Computation-Runtime) | Declared scientific computations and provenance-bearing execution. |
| [Constraint-Based State Reconciliation](https://github.com/giasonpooni/Constraint-Based-State-Reconciliation) | Reconciliation against declared physical or structural constraints. |
| [Geospatial State Visualization](https://github.com/giasonpooni/Geospatial-State-Visualization) | Read-only presentation of geographic and temporal state. |
| [Computational Instrumentation Workbench](https://github.com/giasonpooni/Computational-Instrumentation-Workbench) | Instrument sessions, adapters, inspection, and replay. |

Evaluation, reconciliation, execution, information governance, and visualization
remain separate responsibilities. A display or evaluation result does not grant
authority to change retained evidence or operational state.

## Repository identity and compatibility

The repository was renamed from `State-Estimation-Testbed` to
`State-Estimation-Evaluation-Testbed`. Use the current repository name and
location for documentation and new references.

This naming change preserves the existing `invariant-corpus-v1` schema,
invariant IDs, state-coordinate ID, declared claim scope, and historical
`cites` value. It does not rewrite operation identities, evidence, execution
records, or historical runtime pins.
