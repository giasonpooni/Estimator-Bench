# State Estimation Evaluation Testbed in the instrumentation stack

Notation Systems develops computational instrumentation and evidence infrastructure for industrial and cyber-physical systems.
This component owns **instrument-exchange validation and estimator evaluation scope**. The [stack map](https://github.com/atomtrapping/Notations-Systems-Terminal/blob/main/docs/STACK.md) locates all public components and distinguishes implemented paths from specifications and scaffolds.

## Current boundary

| Property | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Implementation | Executable contract validators, declared-reference metrics and native replay-content verifier; no estimator |
| Workbench connection | Existing exchange checker plus CIW telemetry and calibrated-observable session content/numerical-replay comparison API |
| Inputs | Declared observation batches, result/verification artifacts, covariance metadata, reference samples and retained replay bundle. |
| Outputs | Structural/numerical eligibility, bias/RMSE/NEES/NIS where supported, scoped verification receipt with evidence/result/runtime binding. |

Contract acceptance does not establish estimator accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, independence of verification or physical validity.
Metrics use caller-declared reference truth. Replay outputs must come from a
separately trusted pinned executor; SET compares them but does not execute the
producer or grant ESM admission. An untrusted passed receipt is not authority.

## Interoperability

Integrations use the component's documented contract and an explicit adapter. They preserve source observations, ordered quantities, units, coordinate/frame meaning, time semantics, missingness and declared uncertainty where applicable. An unimplemented field or conversion must be reported as unsupported rather than silently inferred.

Evidence identity names the source record; operation identity names the versioned computation; execution identity names an invocation; result identity names its output; verification identity names a scoped check. These are integration requirements, not a claim that every standalone repository already implements all five record types.

Display names and repository locations do not rename packages, schemas, operation IDs, retained corpus keys or historical runtime pins. CIW integrations use the exact source revisions named in its runtime manifests and operating guides; a provider's current default branch is not a substitute for that binding. Published numerical records retain their original run scope.

Private customer state, deployment configuration and calibration knowledge are outside this public component description. Applicable repository licenses and source-data rights remain controlling; a shared stack identity is not a license grant or a change of repository visibility.

## Read-only exchange path

CIW's [instrument-exchange inspector](https://github.com/atomtrapping/Notations-Systems-Terminal/blob/main/docs/EXCHANGE.md)
checks supported `notation.instrument.*.v1` acquisition/runtime artifacts with
an explicitly pinned State Estimation Evaluation Testbed validator. It retains
full or explicitly unknown covariance and reports content/reference checks.
This is read-only conformance inspection: it does not import a native workspace,
run a scientific provider, admit source evidence or authenticate verification.
The operating guide records the producer/checker revisions and exact limits.
